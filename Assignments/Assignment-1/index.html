            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The oldest known evidence of hominid habitation in Jordan dates back at least 200,000 years. Jordan is a
                rich source of Paleolithic human remains (up to 20,000 years old) due in part to its location within the
                Levant (where various migrations of hominids out of Africa converged).

            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>
                Jordan sits strategically at the crossroads of the continents of Asia, Africa and Europe, in the Levant
                area of the Fertile Crescent, a cradle of civilization.

            <h2>Climate</h2>
            <p>
                The climate in Jordan varies greatly. Generally, the further inland from the Mediterranean, there are
                greater contrasts in temperature and less rainfall.
            </p>
            <h2>Ecology</h2>
            <p>
                Over 2,000 plant species have been recorded in Jordan. Many of the flowering plants bloom in the spring
                after the winter rains and the type of vegetation depends largely on the levels of precipitation.

            <h2>Transportation</h2>
            <p>
                Jordan is ranked as having the 35th best infrastructure in the world, one of the highest rankings in the
                developing world, according to the 2010 World Economic Forum's Index of Economic Competitiveness.
                <br>
                This high infrastructural development is necessitated by its role as a transit country for goods and
                services mainly to Palestine and Iraq.
